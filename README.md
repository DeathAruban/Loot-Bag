## Loot Bag base üåç
in the bags you can find random loots in this case there are 10 loots per bag, which based on the rarity of the bag increases the rarity and quantity of the item or other.
going into the addon folder obviously in your world you have to go to:
```json5
scripts/config/loot
```
here you will find 5 js files in which you can customize your loot, the files are divided by rarity of the bags.
to add an extra loot or modify the existing one it is simple, let's take an example:
```json5
        1:{
            chance:3,
            name:'Beacon Time',
            description:'do you want powers?',
            drop:{
                item:{
                    1:{id:"minecraft:beacon", amount:1},
                },
                effect:{
                    1:{id:'haste',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
                    2:{id:'strength',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
                }
            }
        },
```
its value in this case is 1, already in the config you will find up to 10, to add others just do in numerical order so 11 12 13 and so on
- chance: ( the probability of that loot coming out )
- name : ( name of the loot that will appear in the book )
- description : ( description of the loot that will appear in the book )
- drop : ( here is everything you can do if this loot comes out )

in the drop you can insert:
# Item
item: ( in the item enter what type of object you want to give the player a block, an item whatever you want as in the example below but every time you add an item increase the value, here for example I give 2 items so value 1 item and value 2 item, if you add more you increase )
Inside the item you can insert other values to customize the object when it is given, you can put
```json5
 item:{
   1:{id:"minecraft:emerald",name:'base', amount:5},
   2:{id:"minecraft:emerald_block",name:'Good Emerald',lore:'cool block emerald',amount:1},
 }
```
