## Loot Bag base üåç
in the bags you can find random loots in this case there are 10 loots per bag, which based on the rarity of the bag increases the rarity and quantity of the item or other.
going into the addon folder obviously in your world you have to go to:
```json5
scripts/config/loot
```
here you will find 5 js files in which you can customize your loot, the files are divided by rarity of the bags.
to add an extra loot or modify the existing one it is simple, let's take an example:
```json5
        1:{
            chance:3,
            name:'Beacon Time',
            description:'do you want powers?',
            drop:{
                item:{
                    1:{id:"minecraft:beacon", amount:1},
                },
                effect:{
                    1:{id:'haste',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
                    2:{id:'strength',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
                }
            }
        },
```
its value in this case is 1, already in the config you will find up to 10, to add others just do in numerical order so 11 12 13 and so on
- chance: ( the probability of that loot coming out )
- name : ( name of the loot that will appear in the book )
- description : ( description of the loot that will appear in the book )
- drop : ( here is everything you can do if this loot comes out )

in the drop you can insert:
# Item
item: ( in the item enter what type of object you want to give the player a block, an item whatever you want as in the example below but every time you add an item increase the value, here for example I give 2 items so value 1 item and value 2 item, if you add more you increase )
Inside the item you can insert other values to customize the object when it is given, you can put
- id:( here is the id of the item )
- name: ( the name you want to give the item when it is given to the player )
- amount ( the quantity of that item that must give the player 1 diamond or 3 diamonds )
- lore ( the description then the lore you want to give to the item when it is given to the player )
```json5
 item:{
   1:{id:"minecraft:emerald",name:'base', amount:5},
   2:{id:"minecraft:emerald_block",name:'Good Emerald',lore:'cool block emerald',amount:1},
 }
```
# Sound
sound: ( enter this value if you want it to play a sound )
```json5
sound:'block.lantern.hit'
```  
# Message
message: ( here insert a message that will be sent to the player, if you want more messages just do as in the example below and increase its value )
```json5
message:{
 1:'He how are you',
 2:'I hope so'
 }
```
# Command
command: ( here instead enter the commands that will have to be performed on the player, to add others just increase the value )
```json5
command:{
 1:'title @s title Hii',
 2:'title @s actionbar gg'
 }
```
# Particles
particles: ( if you want it to make particles on the player enter the name of the particle as in the example )
```json5
particles:'minecraft:totem_particle',
```
# Effect
effect: ( instead, if you want to insert classic status effects, just do as in the example and if you want to insert others, just increase the value )
On effects you can decide the time and power of the state using these parameters
- id: ( the name of the effect you want to run )
- time: ( how long the effect should last )
- amplifer: ( when the effect needs to be enhanced )
- particle: ( if you want the particles of the effect to be seen, if you set true they are not seen, if you set false they are seen )
```json5
 effect:{
   1:{id:'haste',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
   2:{id:'strength',time:10000,amplifer:3,particle:true},
 }
```
obviously you can decide what you want to insert in the drop, like the same thing for the item to give the name and lore, these are data that you can also not insert, they simply serve to give greater customization.

# Enity Drop
To find loot bags they are obtained by killing mobs, obviously based on the difficulty the drop reward increases, but if you want to modify or add entities just go to:
```json5
scripts/config/entity
```
Once you will already find the basic Minecraft entities, to add external entities just enter their ID as in the example below.
As per the item, you must each time increase the value which here in the example is 1, but already in the file you will find 73, because all the Minecraft Bedrock entities are present.
This does not affect the classic loot drop of mobs, but only adds.
```json5
    1: {
        id: 'da:floating_text',
        drop: true,
        loot: { 
            0: {id: 'da:loot_bag_common', min: 1, max: 2, chance: 25},
            1: {id: 'da:loot_bag_uncommon', min: 1, max: 2, chance: 15},
            2: {id: 'da:loot_bag_rare', min: 1, max: 1, chance: 10},
            3: {id: 'da:loot_bag_epic', min: 1, max: 1, chance: 5},
            4: {id: 'da:loot_bag_legendary', min: 1, max: 1, chance: 1}
        }
    },
```
- Id: ( name of the entity that must release the loot after death )
- drop : ( if you set true when that entity dies it will give loot, if you set false that entity will not drop loot )
- loot : ( item that must drop after deat )
inside the loot you have to put in order all the items you want to give, which in my case are 5 different Loot Bags
```json5
0: {id: 'da:loot_bag_common', min: 1, max: 2, chance: 25},
```
what you have to put in the drop inside the values
- id: ( name of the item it must give )
- min: ( minimum quantity you must give of that item )
- max :  ( maximum quantity you can give of that item )
- chance : ( probability that from that item )

# Join world message
instead, if you want to deactivate the message when you enter the world of the loot bag, just go to
```json5
scripts/config/config
```
just go to status and set false so the message will no longer come out when you enter the world
```json5
state: false
```
